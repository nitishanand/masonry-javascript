we use one column to list posts, there wonâ€™t be any problems. However, with multiple columns, it is not possible to list the posts with varying length summaries. To keep the consistency of the layout, it is necessary to restrict the summary length. With a Masonry layout, we can list the latest posts in multiple columns without having to truncate the post summaries.
